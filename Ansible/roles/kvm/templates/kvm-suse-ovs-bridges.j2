# Note: during testing of OVS version 2.9.2 on CentOS7 it was found that bridges
# can not simply request DHCP address based on the uplink NIC MAC address.
# Forcing the bridge to use the MAC of uplink NIC caused DHCP leases on both
# interfaces - bridge and uplink. As a result the correct OVS configuration
# is included but commented out below for future use, whilst the configuration
# used uses static IP address based on the DHCP lease at Trillian build time.
